# SQLBot – AI-Powered SQL Query Assistant

## Project Overview
SQLBot is an AI-driven assistant that allows users to query SQL databases using natural language through text or voice. It leverages LangChain SQL agents and SQLDatabaseToolkit to safely convert natural language questions into SQL queries. The system integrates OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text functionality, a Flask backend for processing, and a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Query results are displayed as tables or charts for easy analysis.

## Features
- Speech-to-Text input via OpenAI Whisper  
- Natural language to SQL query translation with LangChain agents  
- Secure SQL execution on databases using SQLDatabaseToolkit    
- Web interface powered by Flask and standard web technologies
